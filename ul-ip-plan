Penn State University Libraries Patent and Trademark Resource Center Strategic Plan

This report attempts to develop a strategy for the Patent and Trademark Resource Center (PTRC) at Penn State, University Park. copyright, patents and trademarks for Penn State University Libraries, including units both inside the Libraries and Penn State as a whole.  In order for Penn State to become a leader in innovation, these units will need to work together across departmental boundaries and campuses.  The University Libraries can use this plan to make decisions to better meet the needs of Penn State students, faculty and staff along with the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

There are already a number of librarians and staff already supporting IP in its various forms.  The Patent and Trademark Resource Center (PTRC), currently residing in the Physical and Mathematical Sciences (PAMS) Library at University Park, is formally designated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  John Meier is the PTRC Librarian, but three other Penn State librarians have participated in training sponsored by the PTRC program.  In addition to the PAMS Library the Engineering Library, Schreyer Business Library, and multiple campuses (Altoona, Behrend, and Hershey in particular) have collections and library instruction in patent and trademark information.

Brandy Karl is the Copyright Officer for the University Libraries and supports many departments in the library such as Publishing and Curation Services, Digitization and Preservation, as well as Access Services.  She also advises departmental faculty outside of the Libraries in fair use and copyright issues.

Penn State Strategic Goals
President Barron has focused on supporting innovation through internal grants, new programs, and innovation across the Commonwealth (References 2-5).  

University Libraries Strategic Plan
Teaching and Learning (Goal 1) The Libraries will expand our role as a partner in online and resident education, increasing our capacity to develop and support engaged, critical, and informed learners through multiple forms of instruction.

Advancing University Research (Goal 1) The Libraries will provide scholarly collections and services needed for cross-disciplinary research by undergraduate, graduate and faculty researchers.

User Needs

Business planning - For example in learning about starting a business and protecting intellectual property there are many entrepreneurship minors and programs at Penn State.  The courses in these programs teach the concepts and skills our students need, but there are gaps in information retrieval information availability and patenting processes that can be provided by the patent and trademark resource center library.

Patent prosecution

Current Services

Intellectual Property Basics

Patent Information Literacy

Global Entrepreneurship Week - Intellectual property including patents needs to be understood both for discovering current state of the art but also for protecting discoveries made by Penn State staff.  Intellectual property and especially patents fit into the entrepreneurship strategy at Penn State with financial and business information this is best represented by the Libraries approach to the current global entrepreneurship week (GEW).

Listing of Key Stakeholders

Key user groups are faculty students and local entrepreneurs.  Each of these has unique and overlapping needs for example faculty require support in their research but also in commercialization of the research.  Some of which is intellectual property they own and some of it is Penn State University's property.  Some students are also employed by the Penn State university and may not own their intellectual property.
